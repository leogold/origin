# modules we'll use
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# for Box-Cox Transformation
from scipy import stats

# for min_max scaling
from mlxtend.preprocessing import minmax_scaling

# plotting modules
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# read in all our data
kickstarters_2017 = pd.read_csv("../input/kickstarter-projects/ks-projects-201801.csv")

# set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(0)

#The difference is that, in scaling, you're changing the range of your data
#while in normalization you're changing the shape of the distribution of your data.
